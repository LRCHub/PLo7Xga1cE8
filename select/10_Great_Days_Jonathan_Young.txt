Break down! Break down!
Break down! Break down!
Break down! Break down!
Break down! Break down!
Shining justice, starting to bloom
Brand new, bed town
Fresh air coming soon
Coming from the tunnel, see
A tower and an ocean breeze
Drawn to one another
Lost our way on narrow streets
Our heart's will (our heart's will)
Into our shadow as one
Shining golden spirits
They are lights we always see they protect me
Let the voice of love
Take you higher!
Going past space and time with the
Gathered fire, oh yeah!
1999 bizarre summer,
The city can thrive with courage
What more can I say
Great days!
Break down! Break down!
Break down! Break down!
Break down! Break down!
Break down! Break down!
Song of praises, sound in the sky
Brand new uptown, scenery goes by
From the breakup in the clouds
Now the light is pouring out
Take me on to narrow streets
That no one else has found!
Undoubtedly (undoubtedly)
To a sparkle as one
Boiling golden
Spirits they are bound for you and me
Never breaking
Let the voice of love
Take you higher!
Going past space and time with the
Gathered fire, oh yeah!
1999 bizarre summer,
The city can thrive with courage
What more can I say
Great days!
Break down! Break down!
Break down! Break down!
Let the voice of love take you higher
Going past space and time with the
Gathered fire, oh yeah
Let the voice of love take you higher
Going past space and time with the
Gathered fire, oh yeah!
1999 bizarre summer
The city can thrive with courage
What more can I say
Great days!
Break down! Break down!
Break down! Break down!
Break down! Break down!
Break down! Break down!
